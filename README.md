# Firefly Jam submission

[![NO AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuxy/no-ai-badge/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nuxy/no-ai-badge)

Game written in [Go](https://go.dev/) (with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/))
for the [Firefly Zero Jam #1](https://itch.io/jam/firefly-jam).

Jam theme: firefly

---

I originally tried creating this game in [MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/)
but I had so many compiler bugs that I ended up giving up and started porting
the game over to Go. See the [`moon-wasm-bug*` tags](https://github.com/applejag/firefly-jam-2026/tags)
on this repo.
